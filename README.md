## Project Title & Short Description

**Title:** Retail Price Elasticity Modeling and Optimization

**Description:** This project develops a predictive regression model to optimize retail product pricing (unit price) by analyzing the influence of historical sales, product attributes, temporal factors, and competitive pricing dynamics on total revenue.

---

## Problem Statement / Goal

The primary goal is to build a robust model capable of predicting the **optimal retail price** (Total Price / Unit Price) for various products. By integrating features such as competitor pricing, holiday seasonality, and product specifications, the system aims to provide data-driven price recommendations that **maximize total revenue** and sales volume.

## Tech Stack / Tools Used

The project utilizes core Python libraries for data science, statistics, modeling, and interactive visualization:

| Category | Tool / Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Handling** | Pandas NumPy | Data loading cleaning and numerical transformations |
| **Visualization**| Plotly | Interactive data visualization for EDA (e.g., Box Plots Scatter Plots) |
| **Modeling** | Scikit-learn (Implied) | Used for model building (Regression) and data splitting |
| **Features** | Lagging Features | Creating time-series features like `lag_price` for historical context |

## Approach / Methodology

1.  **Data Loading and Inspection**: Loaded the `retail_price.csv` dataset, inspected the column types, and confirmed there were no missing values.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted detailed analysis to understand feature relationships, including:
    * **Quantity vs. Total Price** scatter plots.
    * **Total Price by Holiday** box plots to quantify seasonal or event-based pricing impacts.
3.  **Feature Integration**: Utilized a rich set of features including product metadata, customer behavior (`customers`), temporal data (`holiday`, `month`), competitor prices (`comp_1`, `comp_2`, `comp_3`), and a **lagged price** (`lag_price`) to capture time-series dependency.
4.  **Model Training**: A regression model (implied) was trained using the prepared features (`X_test`) to predict the retail price (`y_test`).
5.  **Evaluation**: Model performance was visually assessed by plotting **Predicted vs. Actual Retail Price** against an ideal diagonal line, showing strong alignment and prediction reliability.

## Results / Key Findings

* **Pricing Drivers Identified**: EDA confirmed clear relationships between sales quantity, total price, and key temporal variables like `holiday`.
* **High Predictive Accuracy**: The final scatter plot of predicted vs. actual prices shows that predicted values cluster tightly around the "Ideal Prediction" line, indicating the model is highly accurate and suitable for real-world price recommendations.
* **Competitor Influence**: The inclusion of multiple competitor price points (`comp_1`, `comp_2`, `comp_3`) provides a foundation for sophisticated competitive pricing strategies.
